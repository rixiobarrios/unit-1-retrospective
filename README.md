# unit-1-retrospective

## Accomplishments/What we did right
- Nice-looking, well-formatted code 
- We all made it through Unit 1. We did a lot!
- Working in a group has been super useful. Teamwork is productive! Great group cohesion overall!
- Jade created his own Firebase database!

## Learnings
- Look up documentation - w3schools, MDN, stackoverflow, GeeksForGeeks are great for understanding JS syntax 
- Planning is essential. Self-imposed due dates/to-do lists are helpful! Trello!
- Refactor code to use Object-Oriented pattern
- Being ok with messy code to start
- Being more patient with the project
- Don't compare yourself to others

## Problem Areas
- Opportunity to work on design/UI/UX. Be thoughtful of the user experience of your app!
- Being able to evaluate complexity of a feature - use wireframing and project management tools like Trello to break down a big problem into smaller problems. Learn to iterate on your project.

## Future
- Flexbox/Grid; anything that supports layout
- Trying code out without breaking stuff. Git is the answer! Working with branches.
- Better syntax for JS and being able to refactor
- DRY-er code
- Make fetch calls more performant
- More focus on fundamentals
